# ONTARIO_STATISTICAL_SIMULATON
The Ontario Gateway case requires a simulation of potential losses for Ontario Gateway using data from the OGSIM-A.xls file and Radiant's simulation tool. The simulation involves creating a Binomial variable for each of the three types of planes to estimate the number of crashes per year, with specific values for the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p). 

Additionally, a Uniform variable is used to simulate the cost of incidental damages, ranging from $1 million to $5 million. The total simulated losses are calculated using a simulation formula that combines losses from plane incidents and incidental costs, and a separate formula is created to assess the risk of costs exceeding $37 million, which might indicate a risk of bankruptcy.

The case study uses probabilistic modeling and statistical simulation to analyze insurance options for Ontario Airlines, culminating in a management memorandum that presents findings and recommendations backed by concise and relevant data.
